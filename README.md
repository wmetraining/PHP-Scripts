# PHP-Scripts

This is a collection of scripts that I use for different things.  Some are snippits of code and some are complete scripts

con_js_php_includes.php - This is a script that gets a list of files that reside under the directory list in $files and adds a inlude on the top of all .htm and .html files that don't already have the include.  It then does a search for 3 javascript includes and replaces them with php includes.
